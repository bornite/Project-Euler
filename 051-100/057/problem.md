# Problem 57

It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as
an infinite continued fraction.

$$\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + ...}}} = 1.414213...$$

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}
1 + \frac{1}{2} & = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\
1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} & = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4 \\
1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} & = \frac{17}{12} = 1.41666... \\
1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} & = \frac{41}{29} = 1.41379...
\end{aligned}$$

The next three expansions are $\frac{99}{70}$, $\frac{239}{169}$, and
$\frac{577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\frac{1393}{985}$, is the
first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the
number of digits in the denominator.

In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a
numerator with more digits than denominator?
