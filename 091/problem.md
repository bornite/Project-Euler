title: Right triangles with integer coordinates
---
# Problem 91

The points P(x_{1}, y_{1}) and Q(x_{2}, y_{2}) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form \triangle{OPQ}.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
0 \leq x_{1}, y_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2} \leq 2.

Given that 0 \leq x_{1}, y_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2} \leq 50, how many right triangles can be formed?
