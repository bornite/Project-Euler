# Problem 47

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

$$\begin{aligned}
14 & = 2\times7 \\
15 & = 3\times5
\end{aligned}$$

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

$$\begin{aligned}
644 & = 2^{2}\times7\times23 \\
645 & = 3\times5\times43 \\
646 & = 2\times17\times19
\end{aligned}$$

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?
