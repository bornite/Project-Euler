# Problem 26

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2}&=0.5 \\\\
\frac{1}{3}&=0.\overline{3} \\\\
\frac{1}{4}&=0.25 \\\\
\frac{1}{5}&=0.2 \\\\
\frac{1}{6}&=0.1\overline{6} \\\\
\frac{1}{7}&=0.\overline{142857} \\\\
\frac{1}{8}&=0.125 \\\\
\frac{1}{9}&=0.\overline{1} \\\\
\frac{1}{10}&=0.1
\end{aligned}$$

Where $0.1\overline{6}$ means $0.1666...$, and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $\frac{1}{7}$ has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of $d < 1000$ for which $\frac{1}{d}$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
